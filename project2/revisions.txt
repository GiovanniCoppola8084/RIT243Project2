    Final changes have been made. Only two tests seem to fail out of the 18 total. Did not have time to check the time and memory management.

    Some major changes have been made to the code. Instead of using the parents like before, this maze will be solved by following arrows that were set while creating the neighbors.

    A few things have changed. The node now contains a parent that points to where the node was a step before. This will be used by the BFS solver to find the solution path. The only issue is that it prints fine normally, but gives errors with the numbers in gbd. Still working to fix that now

    mopsolver.c was chhanged so that it does not need a generate_neighbors function. Also, the insert function was changed again so that it can still enter a node a new row and col values.

    Function to insert the node was changed so that it will pass in the node itself to be insert. Not the row and cool. The function calls were also changed.

    Changes have been made to the program succh the DFSS will no longer be implemented. Also, thequeue is now created propely with no valgrind errors.

    Fixed how the maze was being input. It gets taken in fine. Started to fix errors regarding the printing.

    More changes were made in order to fix the issue with the graph not being input properly. The method of printing through the command line arguments was also fixed so that it will only print if an output was provided. Finally, the methods to convert between a matrix and a grid and vice versa were deleted since they were unnecessary.

    Functions were changed so that the array that is being input is a double pointer to start with. The size of the array will be calculated in the input_gaph function using fseek and other various functions. The function calls will be the dereferenced array so tthat the functions can change the values that are necessary

    The BBFS is complete.  The generate_path function still needs to be fixed.

    The solver BFS function is almost complete. A function was made in order to generate the neighbor of the current node, and check if a node is already in the predecessor list.

    The function to solve the BFS was started, the function to find the valid neighbors of a given node were added, and the function to check if a node was already in a list or not was added as well.

    Function and some file documentation was added to the three files that I have created so far. Also, the DFS has been added for the maze to find out if a solution exists or not.

    The mopsolver was changed in order to follow the snake casing standard that was used in the queueList file. Also, some of the command line arguments were changed in order to open the input and output files properly.

    The rest of the functions were added to the queueList header file. These functions include the functions to check if the list is empty,  to add a node to the list, to remove a node from the list, to clear the list, and to destroy the list.

    The header file for the list of visited coordinates that will be used for the BFS algorithm has been added. The basic functions that will be used have also been added. Finally, the first function to create the list has been added in the source file for the queue.

    Switch case for when the user wants to use an output file was changed in order to take in the name of the output file from the command line argument. The function call for PrintMatrix was then changed in order to take in the opened output file.

    Function was added in order to print the matrix to the standard output. It has not been updated so that it can be printed to an output file yet

    Function was added to take in the data from a file pointer. It will be stored in a 1d array first. Then, a function was added in order to convert the 1d array into a matrix for easier use later on. Code was kept in the input function in order for the data to be directly taken into a matrix (This will be kept in for my sake for now). Finally, the memory for the dynamically allocated 1d array was freed at the end of the main.

    Function was added to print the help message to either stdout or stderr based on how the function was being called.

    Initial main function made and set up the structure for the command line arguments. The function prototypes were also added for the print usage/help functions. Definitions were not added yet.
